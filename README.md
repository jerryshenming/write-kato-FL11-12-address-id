write Kato FL11 and FL12 address ID for those only have Dcc-ex controller in hand

Kato FL11 and FL12 DCC decoder only support page mode programming, which unfortunatedly is not supported by DCC-EX controller.
Via this program, you can use your DCC-EX controller arduino to write Address ID.

I have tested by my arduino mega 2560
